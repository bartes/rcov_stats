RcovStats
=========

RcovStats provides rcov extension, so you can select test files and test covered files for unit and functional tests.

How to install :

** for Merb:
  gem install rcov_stats
  ## puts this dependency inside your config/init.rb file ##
  dependency "rcov_stats"
** for Rails
  ## puts this into Gemfile file ##
  gem "rcov_stats"

  ## puts also this code to RakeFile (for Rails3 before Application.load_tasks)

  begin
    require 'rcov_stats_tasks'
  rescue LoadError; end



How to configure

After installation (initialization) you can see rcov_stats.yml in /config directory.
You can specify there :
  - files or directories to be covered by unit tests to cover (units_files_to_cover)
  - files or directories to be covered by functional tests to cover (functionals_files_to_cover)
  - test files or directories with test files which will be used for unit testing (units_files_to_test)
  - test files or directories with test files which will be used for functional testing (functionals_files_to_test)
  - action which will be used before running test suite (before_rcov -> by default db:test:prepare)


You can run:
- rake rcov:stats (includes rcov:units and rcov:functionals)
- rake rcov:units
- rake rcov:functionals
- rake rcov:general (includes rcov:units and rcov:functionals, but counts one general coverage and puts all results in one output directory)
